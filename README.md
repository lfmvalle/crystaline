<b>Crystaline</b>, or simply <b><i>C_</i></b>, is going to be my first serious project using Python.

Its long-term purpose is to help me handle CRYSTAL23 quantum package I/O files from command-line during the timespan of my post-graduation.

Current objective is very simple: data manipulation and plotting of Electronic Band Structure and Density of States.

Recently I have discovered CRYSTALpytools, and I am slowly learning it to further develop this project.

With great effort, I expect future C_ to be multi-purpose CLI to CRYSTAL23.
